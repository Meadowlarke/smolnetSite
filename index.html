<h3> What is the "STL smolnet"? </h3>

The St. Louis smolnet is a decentralized, artist-run, computer network. There are nodes hidden around the city, which you can view by connecting to the wireless network STL.smol. That network hosts a webpage with a piece of site-specific artwork, each node hosts a completely different piece of art. The webserver is connected to local area network only, meaning that it is not connected to the world wide web, or "internet," and only serves the website to devices within a 100-ish foot bubble. The smolnet exists to host art on flexible, inexpensive, DIY infrastructure.   

<h3> Is that safe? </h3>

I'd say so. No digital communications system of any kind is completely impervious to misuse. However, the smolnet is probably safer than any other networked computing that you have done in the recent past. Ultimately, it is just a web page, but you aren't submitting any sensitive data, interacting with other users, or running any code outside of the browser. There aren't even cookies, data collection, or advertising. For these reasons, the smolnet is a pretty safe space compared to the World Wide Web.    

<h3> Who made it? </h3>

This project was made by Eden Attar and her friends Raven Fox, Caro Asercion, Max Raden, and Raphael Palefsky-Smith, whose artwork you can find on this network. Additional support was provided by Sage Voorhees and Isaac Bromley-Dulfano.

<h3> This is weird. Why did you do this? </h3>

I was dissatisfied with the internet and the way that it feels the same no matter where you are geographically---like walking into a TJMaxx. Whether you are logging on to twitter from Los Angeles or somewhere in Maine, the experience is going to be largely the same. The internet is a real, physical infrastructure of wires and machines, probably totalling in the hundreds of millions of tons, but the end experience has been designed in such a way which makes it feel more immaterial than it actually is. 

What if, on the contrary, we built a computer network of small machines that highlight their physical location and geographical specificity? 

<h3> Where do I see them? </h3>

There are 5 nodes hidden around the city of St. Louis. From August 2023 to February 2024 the only way to see them is to visit them on-site in St. Louis. An easily accessible node that you can start at is located at the Central West End Farm. From there you can find other nodes in the network. In February 2024 I will upload mirrors of the nodes here so that the whole world can see them.    

<h3> This is neat, how do I build one of these for myself? </h3>

I'm glad you asked. We made a handy-dandy guide just for you! [link] If you do make one, please feel free to copy the .smol nomenclature.
